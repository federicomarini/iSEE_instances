# Code for generating an instance of iSEE for the data of the Tabula Muris project

Paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/29/237446

Data: The data reported in this article have been made available on GEO (accession code: [GSE109774](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE109774)), as well as from http://tabula-muris.ds.czbiohub.org, following the link on Figshare.

An even cleverer and more straightforward way to access and explore the data is to use the TabulaMurisData Bioconductor package, https://github.com/csoneson/TabulaMurisData.
