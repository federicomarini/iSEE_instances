# iSEE_instances

This repository stores the commands to reproduce entire analyses for iSEE instances on public/own data.

Each dataset/instance can be organised in a folder, with a README.md file and a Rmd document to reproduce the `SummarizedExperiment`/`SingleCellExperiment` objects, which will then ideally saved as .rds files once the workflow is complete.
