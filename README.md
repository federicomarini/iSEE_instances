# Instances of iSEE web-applications

The [_iSEE_](https://github.com/csoneson/iSEE) package provides an interactive user interface for exploring data in objects derived from the `SummarizedExperiment` class.

This repository stores the commands to reproduce entire analyses for _iSEE_ instances on public/own data.

Each dataset/instance can be organised in a folder, with a `README.md` file and a R Markdown (.Rmd) document to reproduce the `SummarizedExperiment`/`SingleCellExperiment` objects, which will then ideally serialized and saved to file (.rds) once the workflow is complete.
